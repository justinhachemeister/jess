### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the bug tracker, or elsewhere in public. Send an email disclosing the vulnerability to [Justin Hachemeister](mailto:f204631e@opayq.com) instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at [Justin Hachemeister](mailto:f204631e@opayq.com).

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 72 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
